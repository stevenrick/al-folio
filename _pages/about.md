I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> specializing in Human-Centered Design. I am advised by <a href="http://weibel.ucsd.edu/">Nadir Weibel</a>.

My dissertation focuses on the sensing of nonverbal behavior between doctors and patients in order to elucidate links between communication and equitable health outcomes. I use mixed methods to understand interpersonal interactions and contextual dynamics, and my work seeks to inform the design of future AI systems to better facilitate human collaboration.

My work spans the fields of user experience, biomedical informatics, human behavior sensing, and applied machine learning.

As a computer scientist and technologist I strive to create systems that alleviate human problems and enhance end-user experiences. As a social scientist and designer I acknowledge that technology may not always be the right answer. Before crafting answers you must understand the problem and people who face it.

Outside of work I enjoy hiking, SCUBA diving, photography, and generally working with my hands.
