I'm currently a PhD Candidate in <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a>. My dissertation work focuses on sensing nonverbal communication behavior between doctors and patients and I am advised by <a href="http://weibel.ucsd.edu/">Prof. Nadir Weibel</a> I previously received my Masters in <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> and my Bachelors in <a href="https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/">Cognitive Science</a>, both from <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>.

My research lives at the intersection of human behavior, technology, and design. Often being applied to the healthcare domain, meaning I often wear many hats. As a computer scientist and technologiest I strive to create systems that alleviate human problems and enhance end-user experiences. As a social scientist and designer I acknowledge that technology may not always be the right answer to every problem.

I am also particularly passionate about the topic of equity. In my research and teaching I focus on the design, use, and evaluation of machine learning applications in manners that acknowledge their underlying bias and minimize inequity.
