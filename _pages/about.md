I'm currently a PhD Candidate in <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a>. My dissertation work focuses on the sensing of nonverbal behavior between doctors and patients in order to elucidate links between communication and equitable health outcomes. I use mixed methods to understand interpersonal interactions, contextual dynamics, and seek to inform the design of future AI systems to better facilitate human collaboration. I am advised by <a href="http://weibel.ucsd.edu/">Prof. Nadir Weibel</a>.

I previously received my MS degree in <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> and my BS degree in <a href="https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/">Cognitive Science</a>, both from <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>.

My research lives at the intersection of human behavior, technology, and design. I have been trained as a Biomedical Informatician (and am thankful for the support I recieved as an <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/GrantTrainInstitute.html">NIH NLM Pre-Doctoral Fellow</a>). I regularly apply myself within the healthcare domain, working on problems ranging from symptom detection and care-coordination to health equity and technology usability. Applied reseach in startup-like settings has continually drawn me in, leading to prior stints at both <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=137">IBM Research</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/medical-health-genomics/?facet%5Btax%5D%5Bmsr-research-area%5D%5B0%5D=13553&sort_by=most-recent">Microsoft Research</a> where I contributed to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2017/04/monitoring-parkinsons-disease/?_ga=2.223422939.1103454808.1632779216-746466771.1632779216">Project BlueSky</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/empowermd/">EmpowerMD</a>, respectively.

As a computer scientist and technologiest I strive to create systems that alleviate human problems and enhance end-user experiences. As a social scientist and designer I acknowledge that technology may not always be the right answer to every problem.

Outside of work I enjoy hiking, SCUBA diving, photography, and generally working with my hands.
